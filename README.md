# TK-Calendar-and-Event-DB
TKinter Calendar GUI with integrated TinyDB events manager

TK-Calendar is a Calendar GUI enhanced with an event database. Events are easy and simple to customize with a topwindow GUI that allows for date picking and event manipulation. I initially made TK-Calendar as a plug in to my home-hub Cherry-Pi project. TK-Calendar can be integrated to any of your TK-Projects by simply changing inheritance of [The main window class: TKCalendar to Toplevel, rather than TK](TKCalendar/main.py)

# A few features of TK-Calendar:

Reactive Date Buttons:
